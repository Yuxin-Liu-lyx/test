              This is an <b>choropleth map projection</b> that shows the the per capita income of different regions of Australia.
              The brightness of the blue in the map reflects the per capita income of the region, 
              with darker colours indicating higher per capita incomes.
            </p>
            <p>
              We can see that the <b>Australian Capital Territory</b> is the deepest blue, although this area is small and not easily visible. 
              This is followed by the <b>Western Australian</b> region. 
              This indicates that the <b>Australian Capital Territory</b> is the region with the highest weekly income per capita,
              which is <b>$1980.6</b>, 
              and <b>Western Australian</b> is the region with the second highest weekly income per capita in Australia,

                        Blue represents public and orange represents private,

                        By looking at this area map, it can be seen that Australia's weekly income per capita has continued to <b>increase</b> over the last <b>decade</b>. 
                        However by <b>2020</b>2, this trend slows down and arguably even disappears.

                    <p>
                        This situation may have been influenced by covid-19, 
                        when the labour market underwent unprecedented changes, 
                        which also had a considerable impact on per capita income.
